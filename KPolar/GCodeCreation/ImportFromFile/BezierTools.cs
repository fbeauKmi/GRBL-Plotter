        /// There seem to be errors in the ControlPolygonFlatEnough function in the
        /// Graphics Gems book and the repository (NearestPoint.c). This function
        /// is briefly described on p. 413 of the text, and appears on pages 793-794.
        /// I see two main problems with it.
        /// 
        /// The idea is to find an upper bound for the error of approximating the x
        /// intercept of the Bezier curve by the x intercept of the line through the
        /// first and last control points. It is claimed on p. 413 that this error is
        /// bounded by half of the difference between the intercepts of the bounding
        /// box. I don't see why that should be true. The line joining the first and
        /// last control points can be on one side of the bounding box, and the actual
        /// curve can be near the opposite side, so the bound should be the difference
        /// of the bounding box intercepts, not half of it.
        /// 
        /// Second, we come to the implementation. The values distance[i] computed in
        /// the first loop are not actual distances, but squares of distances. I
        /// realize that minimizing or maximizing the squares is equivalent to
        /// minimizing or maximizing the distances.  But when the code claims that
        /// one of the sides of the bounding box has equation
        /// a * x + b * y + c + max_distance_above, where max_distance_above is one of
        /// those squared distances, that makes no sense to me.
